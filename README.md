# Dividend-Forecasting
This project aims to forecast the dividend payments of companies in different sectors for the next year. The forecasts are based on historical data of dividend payments and other financial and non-financial indicators that may affect dividend decisions, such as earnings, cash flow, debt, market conditions, etc. The project uses machine learning and statistical techniques to build models that can learn from past patterns and make predictions about the future.

## Data Sources
The project uses a variety of data sources to collect information about companies and sectors, including:
Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement)
Market indices and macroeconomic indicators (GDP, GNP , Market Confidence level etc.)
The data is collected from Bloomberg Terminal. The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and merged into a single dataset that can be used for modeling and analysis.

## Methodology
The project uses and machine learning techniques regression and random forest. The models are trained on a historical dataset that covers dividend payments from 2018 - 2021 and other relevant data, and then tested on a hold-out dataset of year 2022. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics, and then refined or combined to achieve better results.

The project also includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model interpretation and visualization to better understand the relationships between different variables and the drivers of dividend decisions.
